# Open Ticket Specification

The open ticket format is described here.  

Fields that are common to all tickets are standardized and placed in sections for organization.  These are the "Core" fields for tickets.

Fields that are custom to a center are contained in the custom field groups section after all the core ticket sections.

Each section includes a description of what that section contains, followed by a sample in JSON format.  Finally, each field in the section is described along with its data type and maximum length (for strings).


## Data Types

Common and Custom field should conform to the following value types:

**DateTime** - All dates should be transmitted in ISO 8601 format with time zone information.  For greatest compatibility, use millisecond precision (3 decimal places of precision).  Dates for excavation tickets are very close to the present time, so the minimum and maximum values of all receiving systems should never be an issue.

**Integer** – A signed value that can be represented by 32 bits, from -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647.  This is a signed value because most systems default to a signed integer.  A Max value can be specified if appropriate.  For instance, if the custom field should only have a value up to 99, then set this as the Max value.

**Float** – A signed floating point value that can be represented by 32 bits.

**String** – A string value, the value of Max indicates the maximum length of the string.  The Max should be specified for all custom string fields.  This can help the receiving system store as well as display this value appropriately.

**Text** – A string with no maximum length.  The use of these fields should be very limited (for instance, only used for WKT values).  

**Boolean** – The value for these custom fields can be True, False, or Null.

The type for custom fields is specified in its Type value as part of its definition.  Common field types have value types and valid values or lengths defined in their descriptions below.

# Open Ticket Format Sections

**Header** – Information to identify the ticket and process it.

**Work Site** – information about where the excavation is happening.

**Geography** - all geographic information for the ticket.

**Locate Information** – Locate instructions, remarks, and driving directions.  These are needed by the locator to properly locate the facilities.

**Project** – Additional information about the excavation project.  This is not required for the location, but is useful in damage prevention, such as whether or not explosives will be used, or the expected duration of the excavation.

**Timeline** – Dates commonly associated with tickets.  Dates specific to a ticket type should be in Custom Fields instead.

**Excavator** – information about the excavator.

**Custom Fields** – custom fields with their metadata for this specific ticket type.

**Members** – The utility companies that are being notified to locate facilities.

**Response History** – This section shows the response history for this ticket.  Initially, this may be blank.  Any resends of the ticket would contain the response history as of the resend date and time.

**Attachments** - Section to include binary attachments in the file.

# Header

The first section of the JSON format is the header object.   The purpose of the header is to identify the ticket and other data regarding the transmission.  The inspiration for this section is that of an IP header that contains information about the delivery and routing of an IP packet.  In this case, it is about the delivery and potential routing of a ticket.

```
"header": {
    "formatVersion": "0.5",
    "ticketNumber": "230815-001003",
    "ticketVersion": 0,
    "sequence": 12,
    "source": "Voice",
    "type": "Normal",
    "standardType": "Normal",
    "action": "New",
    "class": null,
    "priority": "Normal",
    "isTest": false,
    "centerName": "GA811",
    "memberIds": [
      "GAUPC"
    ],
    "trace": [
      {
        "dateTime": "2023-08-08T07:32:05.493-04:00",
        "action": "sent",
        "host": "GA811 GeoCall"},
      {
        "dateTime": "2023-08-08T07:35:26.157-04:00",
        "action": "received",
        "host": "BigCity Lights EMC BCSTicket"
      },
      {
        "dateTime": "2023-08-08T10:42:22.736-04:00",
        "action": "sent",
        "host": "BigCity Lights EMC BCSTicket",
      },
      {
        "dateTime": "2023-08-08T10:43:01.412-04:00",
        "action": "received",
        "host": "Accurate Locating, Inc. Dispatch",
      }
    ]
  },
```

**Format Version (formatVersion)** string (10) – This is the version of the Open Ticket Format specification this JSON document represents.  When new versions of the specification are developed, this will allow receivers to know what version of the specification the transmission follows.  For centers not yet implementing newer versions, they can continue to send, and receivers can continue to receive for that version of the spec.  Once a center or receiver has upgraded their system to the latest spec, then they can coordinate the changeover to the new format.

**Ticket Number (ticketNumber)** string (25) – this is the ticket number.

**Ticket Version (ticketVersion)** integer - the version number for the ticket, if the source system uses ticket versioning.

**Sequence (sequence)** integer – this is a serial number of this transmission for this receiver.   This allows the receiver to know what order tickets were sent to them in a day.  Since this format can be used for transmissions of tickets as well as retrieval of tickets by API call, this will only have a value if this is a transmission.
[This is very much like a session number for networking.  This identifies the order the ticket was transmitted each day, as if each ticket were a packet sent in a daily session]

**Source (source)** string (30) – this is the channel (Call Center, Web Portal, etc.) the ticket was submitted through.

**Type (type)** string (60) – the legal ticket type for this ticket.

**Standard Type (standardType)** string (60) – the standard ticket type for this ticket.  This should be mapped to a national standard.  For instance, “Design Request” might be the legal ticket type defined by a state law, but “Design” would be an appropriate “standard” type.  Each center should define their ticket type mappings to a national standard.

- Normal - standard new production ticket for normal excavation and notice periods
- Emergency - immediate work that must be performed to eliminate danger to life, health, property, etc.
- Short Notice - work that must begin before the normal notice period, but not an emergency ticket
- Design - non-excavation work used for planning purposes
- No response - notification to a member that they have not marked in the time provided
- Cancel - a notification of a cancellation of another ticket
- Correction - a replacement ticket with updated information
- Remark - a ticket sent to request updated markings on an existing ticket
- Update - a ticket to renew the excavation for additional time
- Damage - a notification of a damage
- Project - a longer-term excavation than a Normal ticket
- Other - any ticket that does not fit another category

**Action (action)** - The action that caused this ticket to be created, such as New (for a new request), Resend, Cancel, 2nd Notice, Relocate, Late, etc.

**Class (class)** - Classification for the ticket, if used by the center.  Centers that use qualifiers in their ticket types can use class to modify the base Type (above).  Centers that do not use Class should send a NULL value.

**Priority (priority)** string (10) – This helps the receiver determine how fast this ticket needs to be processed.  Values may include:
	Normal – This should be processed after Rush or Emergency tickets
  Rush – This should be processed before Normal priority tickets, but after emergency priority tickets
	Emergency – This should be processed before other priority types.

**IsTest (isTest)** boolean – If implemented by the center, this would allow them to send test tickets to members and have them identify those tickets as test tickets.  Although most testing is done using test systems, there is still a need for test tickets to be sent through production systems.  This would allow the identification of test tickets that do not require an actual locate to be performed. If this is not implemented by the center, a NULL value should be sent.

If this is not implemented by the center’s system, then this flag should indicate Null.  This will tell the receiver that the sending system does not implement this feature, rather than False which would indicate the center positively identifying this as a production ticket.

**Center Name (centerName)** string (25) – an identifier for the center transmitting the ticket.  This is most often the state abbreviation plus “811”.

**Member Ids (memberIds)** string (10) array – this is an array of string values containing the alphanumeric member identifiers for the facilities included in this transmission.  This allows a single ticket to be delivered for multiple facilities for a single operator.  For instance, a member who operates water and sewer facilities may receive a single ticket that includes the codes for the water and sewer facilities they operate, so this would contain both member ids corresponding to those facilities.

This is helful for routing tickets to the appropriate internal group for the recipient.  For instance, contract locator companies with many customers can use this to route the ticket to the appropriate locator.

Since this format can be used for transmissions of tickets as well as retrieval of tickets by API call, this will only have a value if this is a transmission.

**Trace (trace)** array of trace objects - this section contains the trace information for this ticket.  The trace information is information appended to the ticket by each system that processes a ticket.  This allows for inspecting the path the ticket has taken through various systems.  This information will be more critical as more systems are used for processing and forwarding tickets.

> **DateTime (dateTime)** DateTime - The date and time of the event (ticket send or receive).
>  
> **Action (action)** string (20) - typically "send" or "receive".  What action is being taken on the ticket.  Other actions can be specified, such as routing to internal processing or groups.
> 
> **Host (host)** string (100) - an identifier to show the organization and host name of the system processing the ticket for this action.

# Work Site

The work site information is all the information regarding where the excavation is occurring.  The information in this section is used by the receiver to identify the location of the work site.

```
"workSite": {
    "countryCode": "US",
    "stateProvince": "GA",
    "county": "Cobb",
    "place": "Smyrna",
    "fullAddress": "123 Another LN SE",
    "addressNumber": "123",
    "addressPrefix": "",
    "addressStreetName": "Another",
    "addressStreetType": "LN",
    "addressSuffix": "SE",
    "intersection": "Highway 25"  
  },
```

**Country Code (countryCode)** string (2) – specifying a country code allows this specification to be used in countries other than the United States.  This should be the ISO Alpha-2 code for the country, such as US for the United States, or CA for Canada.

**State/Province (stateProvince)** string (2) – a two-character abbreviation for the state or province.

**County (county)** string (75) – the name of the county for the work site.

**Place (place)** string (75) – the city, town, or unincorporated place name.

**Full Address (fullAddress)** string (370) – the full street address for the work site.

**Address Number (addressNumber)** string (20) – number part of the address.  This is a string, not a number, to accommodate alphabetic characters (‘34B’ for instance).

**Address Prefix (addressPrefix)** string (10) – A prefix to the street name, normally directional (North, East, West, etc.)

**Address Street Name (addressStreetName)** string (300) – The street name.

**Address Street Type (addressStreetType)** string (30) – The type of street (Rd, St, Blvd, Hwy, etc.)

**Address Suffix (addressSuffix)** string (10) – A suffix, normally directional (North, East, West, etc.)

**Intersection (intersection)** string (370) – the name of the nearest intersecting street.

          ]
        ]

    }
  ]
},
```

The spatialArea property of the ticket contains the geography for the ticket in a GeoJson compatible form ([RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)).

The geographic information for each ticket is a FeatureCollection containing at least two features.  One feature will be the Excavation Site, and the second would be the Buffered Excavation Site.  These features are differentiated by using a "layer" property for the feature. Each feature will be identified as an "excavationSite" or a "bufferedSite".

```
"properties": {
    "layer": "excavationSite"
}
```
OR
```
"properties": {
    "layer": "bufferedSite"
}
```

If a ticket contains multiple excavation areas, then the ticket would have multiple features identified as "excavationSite"s and "bufferedSite"s.

The features also include an **id** which is a (zero-based) index value to indicate the number of the feature that can be used to uniquely identify that feature on the ticket.  This allows senders and receivers to have a way to have a common unique identifier for features when troubleshooting (for instance).

**Multiple Excavation Site Example**
If there are mulitple shapes that define the excavation site such as a polygon for a power station and a point for a nearby power pole, then the features might look like this (focussing on the Id and Properties of the GeoJson, excluding the actual coordinates for clarity):

```
"id": 0,
"properties": {
    "layer": "excavationSite"
},
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
.
.
.
"id": 1,
"properties": {
    "layer": "excavationSite"
},
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
.
.
.
"id": 2,
"properties": {
    "layer": "bufferedSite"
},
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
.
.
.
"id": 3,
"properties": {
    "layer": "bufferedSite"
},
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
```

Each feature can be referenced using the id, and each feature identifies with the Layer property if it is either the excavation site, or the buffered excavation site.

**Bounding Box**

In addition, the FeatureCollection itself has a bounding box property (**bbox**).  This can be used by the receiver to set a display window that will encompass the entire geometry included in the ticket.

**Notes**
1. GeoJson assumes the coordinate reference system to be WGS84.

2. Coordinate values should be limited to 6 digits (11.1 cm resolution at the equator).  This should handle the resolution that is needed in the 811 industry, and keeping this limited to 6 digits speeds up processing time for recievers.  This is the recommendation from the GeoJson spec (section 11.2 Coordinate Precision).

3. Any buffered geometry should minimize the number of points used in rounding endcaps.  Reducing the number of points simplifies the calculations needed to be performed, so reduced processing time.


# Locate Information

This section contains the information the locator needs to mark facilities at the work site.

```
"locateInformation": {
    "isWhiteLined": false,
    "locateInstructions": "FRONT RIGHT - DAF",
    "remarks": "fdgaewsfa",
    "drivingDirections": ""
  },
```

**Locate Instructions (locateInstructions)** text – Instructions to the locators explaining what to locate.

**Remarks (remarks)** text – Additional remarks about the ticket.

**Driving Directions (drivingDirections)** text – Any driving directions for the locators

# Timeline

This section should contain all the dates for the ticket.

*All dates should be transmitted in ISO 8601 format with time zone information.  For greatest compatibility, use millisecond precision (3 decimal places of precision).  For a discussion on time precision between programming languages, visit (https://nickb.dev/blog/iso8601-and-nanosecond-precision-across-languages/)*.

```

  },
```
**Created On (createdOn)** datetime – The date and time the ticket was created.

**Response Due (responseDue)** datetime - The date and time responses are due for this ticket.  If no time is included, this is assumed to be be inclusive of the entire date (i.e. a due date of 4/1/2024 has all day 4/1/2024 to respond).

**Legal On (legalOn)** datetime – the date and time the ticket is legal to dig.

**Work On (workOn)** datetime – the date the excavator states that work will begin.

**Update By (updateBy)** datetime – the date and time the ticket needs to be updated.  After this date and time, a new ticket would be needed.

**Expires On (expiresOn)** datetime – the date and time the ticket will expire.

# Project

The project section contains information about the excavation project itself.  What type of work, who the work is being performed for, and whether directional boring or explosives will be used.

# Custom Field Groups

Custom fields are listed in this section.  Custom fields are contained within a group which defines a group name, display name, and then the list of custom fields.

If the group name matches an existing ticket section (such as timeLine or workSite) then that custom field is intended to be displayed in the same section as the other fields in that section by the receiving system.  If it does not match, then the fields in that group are intended to be displayed in a new, supplemental section.  It is intended that the name of that new group would be what is in the Display Name property for that group.

```

          "value": "230815-001002",
          "max": 50
        }

    }

```

Each group within this section has these properties:

**Group Name (groupName)** string (100) – this is a key value that can be used to identify the group.  This is in camel case to be compatible with automated systems.

**Display Name (displayName)** string (100) – This is a human friendly name for the group that can also be used in the receiving system’s user interface.

**Fields (fields)** – this is an array of custom fields, each with the following properties:

   **Field Name (fieldName)** string (100) – This is a computer-friendly name that can be used as a key value for the receiving system.  This should not contain special characters or spaces.

   **Display Name (displayName)** string (100) – The display name of the custom field as it should appear to anyone viewing the information.

   **Type (type)** string (20) – The type of information this field contains, such as String for text, DateTime for date/time values, Boolean for true/false values, Integer for a whole number value, or Number for a numeric value containing a decimal portion.  See Appendix A for value types.

   **Value (value)** string (4000) – This is a textual representation of the value.  This can be used in combination with the Type above to translate the value into an appropriate native representation of that value on the receiving system.  So, an integer can be translated from the text value here into a native integer data type variable so that it can be used appropriately.  If that custom field does not have a value, this attribute will be “null”.

   **Max (max)** integer – The maximum number of characters the value can have, or the maximum value for a numeric field.

# Members

The members that have facilities in the work site area will be listed in this section, including their names and phone numbers.  This section is a list of member items.  The sample section contains two members:

```
"members": [
    {
      "memberId": "ABC120",
      "memberName": "DEMO CITY GAS - ABC120",
      "facilityTypes": [
        "Gas"
      ],
      "phoneNumbers": [
        {
          "phone": "9995551234",
          "extension": "",
          "type": "Main"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "memberId": "DEMO230",
      "memberName": "CITY OF DEMO WATER – DEMO230",
      "facilityTypes": [
        "Water"
      ],
      "phoneNumbers": [
        {
          "phone": "8885554587",
          "extension": "",
          "type": "Main"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

**Member Id (memberId)** string (10) – The alphanumeric value representing the service area for the member.

**Member Name (memberName)** string (300) – The member’s name.

**Facility Types (facilityTypes)** string (40) array – This is an array of strings containing the facility types this member operates in the service area represented by the member id (above).

**Phone Numbers (phoneNumbers)** array – this is an array of phone number objects containing phone information for the member.  These objects contain the following information:

   **Phone (phone)** string (10) – The phone number.

   **Extension (extension)** string (10) – The extension.

   **Type (type)** string (20) – The type of phone number.  For instance, “Main” would be the phone number for most contact types, but many members have a “Damage” number that should be called to report any damages.

# Response History

This section contains the response history for all the members on the ticket.  This is useful if the ticketing system automatically adds responses in cases (for instance, corrected tickets that add a new member but wants to retain the response history of all others members), or if the ticket is re-sent.

```
"responseHistory": [
    {
      "memberId": "DEMO123",
      "memberName": "DEMO GAS – DEMO123",
      "facilities": [
        "Gas"
      ],
      "responseEntries": [
        {
          "responseDate": "2023-08-19T00:10:01.620-04:00",
          "responseCode": "LATE",
          "responseDescription": "Response is late",
          "respondent": "System",
          "comment": "Added by System"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "memberId": "ABC999",
      "memberName": "CITY OF DEMO WATER – DEMO999",
      "facilities": [
        "Water"
      ],
      "responseEntries": [
        {
          "responseDate": "2023-08-19T00:10:02.167-04:00",
          "responseCode": "LATE",
          "responseDescription": "Response is late",
          "respondent": "System",
          "comment": "Added by System"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

**Member Id (memberId)** string (10) – the alphanumeric value that identifies the members facilities.

**Member Name (memberName)** string (300) – the name of the utility company that this response is for.

**Facilities (facilities)** string (40) array – a string array of the facility types for this member’s response

**Response Entries (responseEntries)** – an array of responses, each containing the following fields:

   **Response Date (responseDate)** datetime – the date/time the response was recorded

   **Response Code (responseCode)** string (10) – the name or code of the response.

   **Response Description (responseDescription)** string (300) – the full meaning of the response.

# Attachments

Attachments to tickets are Base64 encoded binary values contained in a simple object collection where the object has a name and a value.

```
"attachments":[
  {
      "name":"Satellite",
      "mimeType":"image/png",
      "value":"MIIHNjCCBh6gAwIBAgIQCVe4E0h49mzI0NcSqMy1+jANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADB1"
  },
  {
      "name":"Project Plan",
      "mimeType":"application/pdf",
      "value":"NTk1OVowgcoxHTAbBgNVBA8MFFByaXZhdGUgT3JnYW5pemF0aW9uMRMwEQYLKwYB"
  }
]
```

**Name (name)** string (200) - a descriptive name describing the attachment.

**Mime Type (mimeType)** string (255) - the mime type for the binary information stored in the value field (below).  This is needed so the receiver can correctly interpret the binary data.

**Value (value)** text - Base64 encoded binary value.
